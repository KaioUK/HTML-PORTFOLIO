<h1>The Best Movies According to David</h1>
<h2> My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> Spider-man into the spiderverse</h3>
<p>The movie goes into responsibility and the expectations that come with taking them on and is a good coming of age story in a way too</p>
<h3> John Wick</h3>
<p>The movies choreography in terms of its action scenes were phenomenal 
<h3> Weathering with you </h3>
<p> The movie has the protagonist risk everything when it comes to trying to get his love interest back and the fact he put them before the world showed how much he cared </p>
